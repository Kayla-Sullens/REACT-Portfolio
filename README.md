# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my React Portfolio, to showcase skills in a different way. I was able to use a lot of what I had from my first portfolio, but made the proper adjustments for React. The Contact page is also a lot different, with adding a form for others to contact me. This form currently does NOT work, but the front-end functionality is there.
